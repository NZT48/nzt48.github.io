# Personal Website and Blog

Welcome to my website and blog hosted as a GitHub page. This site is generated using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast and flexible static site generator written in Rust. The design and layout are built upon the [Hermit Zola theme](https://github.com/VersBinarii/hermit_zola).
