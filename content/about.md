Hello world! My name is Nikola Todorovic. I'm an explorer of knowledge who thrives on constant learning, deeply immersed in the ever-evolving realms of cybersecurity and decentralization.

By day, I'm the Lead Blockchain Engineer at [TraceLabs](https://tracelabs.io/) ([OriginTrail](https://origintrail.io/) core developers), where I've had the incredible opportunity to be at the forefront of the blockchain and knowledge graphs intersection. In the OriginTrail ecosystem, I played a pivotal role in crafting the [OriginTrail Parachain](https://parachain.origintrail.io/) and building the groundbreaking [Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)](https://dkg.origintrail.io/).

As a member of the [Cyber Security Network Foundation](https://cybersecurityserbia.rs/), I've had the privilege of organizing the [Serbian Cybersecurity Challenge](https://cyberhero.rs/scc/). But that's not all â€” I also serve as a coach for the Serbian national team, which competes on the [European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC)](https://ecsc.eu/). Additionally, I'm the proud member of the CyberHero [community](https://discord.gg/QRVB4h8cre) and [CTF team](https://ctftime.org/team/130070), nurturing the next generation of cybersecurity experts.

I'm curious about the crossroads where security meets other computer science fields. On this blog, you'll find discussions about topics like smart contracts security, SPARQL injection, open-source intelligence (OSINT)...

List of other projects that I am involved:
* Hacklab Belgrade (HKLBGD)
* [Descon conference](https://descon.me/)
