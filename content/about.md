Hello world! My name is Nikola Todorovic. I'm a blockchain engineer with a keen interest in security, constantly exploring the intersection of cybersecurity and decentralization.

I graduated from the School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Belgrade, majoring in Computer Engineering and Information Theory. Additionally, I am a graduate of the [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://www.polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/), Cambridge cohort, where I deepened my expertise in blockchain technologies.

Previously, I was the Lead Blockchain Engineer at [TraceLabs](https://tracelabs.io/) ([OriginTrail](https://origintrail.io/) core developers), where I played a pivotal role in developing the [NeuroWeb AI Blockchain](https://neuroweb.ai/) and the innovative [Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)](https://dkg.origintrail.io/). I continue to contribute to these projects, staying at the forefront of blockchain and knowledge graph technologies.

As a member of the [Cyber Security Network Foundation](https://cybersecurityserbia.rs/) and coach of the Serbian national team for the [European Cyber Security Challenge (ECSC)](https://ecsc.eu/), and a key organizer of the [Serbian Cybersecurity Challenge](https://cyberhero.rs/scc/), I am deeply involved in the cybersecurity community. I also participate actively in the [CyberHero community](https://cyberhero.rs) and [CTF team](https://ctftime.org/team/130070), nurturing the next generation of cybersecurity experts.

I'm curious about the crossroads where security meets other computer science fields. On this blog, you'll find discussions about topics like smart contracts security, SPARQL injection, open-source intelligence (OSINT)...

List of other projects that I am involved:
* Hacklab Belgrade (HKLBGD)
* [Descon conference](https://descon.me/)
* [LiBRE! Magazine](https://libre.lugons.org/)
* [PSSOH (Application of Free Software and Open Hardware) conference](https://pssoh.etf.bg.ac.rs/)
* [Polkadot Blockchain Academy](https://www.polkadot.network/development/blockchain-academy/)
